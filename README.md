# MLight
Firmware for an expansion module based on MGM210L Silabs module: https://github.com/Adminiuga/MGM210-Expansion

# Building
This is being developed with VSCode and I have not tried building it using Simplicity Studio.
This relies on [https://github.com/Adminiuga/Raz1_custom_components_extension](https://github.com/Adminiuga/Raz1_custom_components_extension) custom extensions installed with your Gecko SDK.
